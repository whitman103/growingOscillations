# growingOscillations
 
A developing C++ agent-based model which examines the effect of multiple interacting compartments in an infectious disease simulation. The driving question is what is the effect of an increasing degree of social connection as a function of time; in other words, if a group of people slowly become more socially connected as a function of time, how do the dynamics unfold?

The simulation is built from several interacting subpopulations which can be connected or not. The full simulation currently runs 10 populations of 1000 weakly connected individuals in about a second.
